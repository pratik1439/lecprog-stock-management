The purpose of this project is to develop a generic desktop Java application which can manage inputs and outputs for stocks of various products grouped into categories.

You can download the last version (demo), LecprogStocks\_v\_2\_3.zip, from "Downloads" section.

In order to evaluate "Lecprog stock management" software, you have to unzip "LecprogStocks\_v\_2\_3.zip" file. After unzip you'll get a folder named "DLecprogStocks\_2\_3". If Windows is your operating system, you can run this application by launching "ForWindows.cmd" file from "DLecprogStocks\_2\_3" folder or, alternatively, you can open a command window (DOS window), you change the folder to "DLecprogStocks\_2\_3" and run the command  "java -jar LecprogStocks\_2\_3.jar".
If Linux is the operating system installed on your computer then you can open a Terminal window, you change the folder to "DLecprogStocks\_2\_3" and run the command "sh ForLinux.sh"  or  "java -jar LecprogStocks\_2\_3.jar".
In order to use this application, you must have JRE 1.6 or 1.7 (Java Runtime Environment) installed on your computer, corresponding to your operating system. You can download JRE (1.6 Update 37 or 1.7) from Oracle website: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
